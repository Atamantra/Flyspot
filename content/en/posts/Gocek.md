## Göcek
When we mention Göcek, the first things that come to mind are yachts, *high-priced* **white sandy beach**, both natural and **luxurious bazaar**, and **marina**. However, we must also mention that it is a place worth seeing even if your budget is limited. Göcek beach, which you can visit without spending too much time, is a favorite spot for those who want to take photos of the **river** flowing into the sea after a beach walk. There are also many beautiful places for a romantic seaside dinner. If you want to swim in the sea but it's not within your budget, you can go to the **Inlice Public Beach**, which is close to Göcek and affiliated with Göcek. Both the public cafe and the beach itself are surprisingly calm and affordable (excluding fluctuations due to weather conditions).
