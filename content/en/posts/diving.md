## Whether You Choose Hourly Diving or Daily Diving

Fethiye is one of the most beautiful locations for diving, where you can encounter a variety of marine life in the crystal-clear waters where the Mediterranean and Aegean meet. Let's start with some common questions that travelers who want to dive may have.

**Question:** Do I need to know how to swim to dive?
- You don't need to be a proficient swimmer to dive, but being comfortable in the water is essential.

**Question:** Do I need prior diving experience?
- You don't need prior diving experience either; after receiving pre-dive training and overcoming any concerns with expert instructors, you'll be ready for your first dive.

**Question:** I have concerns about pressure; how can I overcome this fear?
- In terms of pressure sensitivity during diving, you'll learn to balance pressure between your mouth, nose, and ears, and you can also communicate how you're feeling with simple hand signals. Despite seeming complicated at first glance, you'll realize that diving is actually simple and fun with this experience.

(As someone who has experienced pressure trauma multiple times, I must share that I thoroughly enjoy diving and always want to do it again.)

**Question:** Do we have insurance for diving?
- Necessary equipment, clothing, and pre-dive insurance are all included in the activity.

**Question:** What if I feel uncomfortable due to pressure during diving; did I waste my money on this activity?
- Of course not! You can continue to explore with snorkeling gear, relax on the boat, or swim in the coves you visit.

## What to Consider When Planning Diving
**When planning activities typically done during vacations, prioritization is necessary.**
If you plan to dive and do another activity on the same day, we strongly recommend scheduling your dive for later in the day.

Mild ear congestion can make you feel a bit tired for a few hours or the rest of the day.

### So, how should you decide between hourly and daily diving?

# - Hourly Diving -
**Hourly diving offers a great alternative in terms of time planning.**
## Boat Diving

By departing from Oludeniz on a boat to visit [Blue Cave](/uploads/Diving/Spots/bluecave.jpeg) or [Aquarium Bay](), you'll have a chance to dive with pre-dive training. The round trip of the boat departing from Oludeniz takes approximately 2-3 hours, allowing you to join daily dives at 4-5 different times.

## Another Alternative: Shore Diving

If you prefer shore diving for a better quality dive, you can do hourly diving at our diving center located at Kumburnu in Oludeniz. It's a rare education center where you can receive training packages tailored to every level and earn certifications from international organizations based on your goals.

# - Daily Diving -
Daily diving involves leaving around 9-10 in the morning and returning around 4-5 in the afternoon, allowing you to spend a day on the boat visiting 2 different coves, swimming, diving, sunbathing, and including **your lunch.üçõ** After an initial dive and then a full dive, you'll return fully satisfied with your daily diving experience. When it comes to deciding, there's something we've known since childhood: **the sea tires you out.** Even a short time in the sea can tire you out, and the longer you spend, the more tired you become.

- Diving, involving pressure, can be both fun and tiring. If you've dived before and have experience planning your entire day around it, hourly diving might be the best choice for you.
- If you're unsure how tiring diving will be and your holiday days are limited, adding diving as the last activity of the day can be a good option.
- Paragliding and diving are often asked about together. Since paragliding exposes you to atmospheric pressure that lifts you higher, and diving exposes you to water pressure that takes you deeper, it's best to do the activity that involves less pressure first, which is usually paragliding.

**When planning your day on holiday and if you're not in a hurry, and if it's your first dive or first dive in Fethiye, daily diving is the best choice. Who wouldn't want to spend the whole day going from cove to cove diving on a boat? Your evening meal and the sleep you'll have after that will be one of the sweetest.ü§ø**
