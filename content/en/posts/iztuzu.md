## Iztuzu Beach
Located within the Dalyan district, Iztuzu Beach is one of the rare beaches where fresh and saltwater meet. As you'll notice along the beach, with the turtle signs and protected areas for turtle eggs, this beach is where Caretta Caretta turtles lay their eggs, hence it is also known as "Turtle Beach." The beach closes between **8:00 PM and 8:00 AM** to avoid disturbing the sea turtles and to protect their nesting areas. Additionally, there are cafes and parking services available at the beach.

During our visits to Iztuzu Beach, we must mention that we highly recommend visiting the Turtle Hospital located at the entrance. In this hospital, you can gain detailed information about sea turtles and contribute to their conservation efforts. Observing the turtles undergoing treatment will surely change your perspective on the environment with the empathy you'll develop for them.
