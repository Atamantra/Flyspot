## Microlight

### What Is Microlighting?
 A microlight is a small-scale, fuel-operated, lightweight aircraft. Also known as an ultralight, this aircraft is commonly referred to as **"motorized sail wing" or "ultralight"**. Resembling a minimally designed airplane, it is suitable for flying **one or two people.** It requires a **runway for takeoff and landing** safety. It undergoes permanent technical and maintenance checks by the [**Civil Aviation General Directorate**](https://web.shgm.gov.tr/en). The use of an unchecked aircraft is **strictly prohibited.** Microlight flights are conducted with third-party insurance and considered as one of the **safest** aviation methodes.

### What To See?
With a Microlight tour in [Dalyan Delta](dalyan), you will have the opportunity to see the Rock Tombs, the Ancient City of **Kaunos**, the **Dalyan Delta**, and the **Iztuzu Beach** from a bird's-eye view, all of which are undoubtedly worth seeing. Moreover, there's nothing quite like observing the loggerhead sea turtles and fish in the sea from above during the summer season.
### How Long Does The Microlight Flight Take?
Microlight flights operate at an altitude of **300-400 meters**, with a total flight time of **17 to 20 minutes**, excluding takeoff and landing time (engine start-up and shutdown). There may be a slight variation of 2-3 minutes depending on **weather conditions.**
### What Are The Limits?
The flight is carried out with **1 pilot and 1 passenger**, and taking on another passenger, regardless of age, is **prohibited** and is also not covered by insurance. There is **no age limit** for flying, as long as there are no hyperactive mental issues. There is a weight limit of **120 kg** for passengers, and if the passenger weighs over 120kg when weighed before the flight, the flight will be **canceled.**
### What Should I Wear?
You only need to come dressed appropriately for the season for the flight. However, if you feel cold, our pilot, Mr. Mustafa, will provide you with a jacket.
