## Green Valley

One of the hidden beauties of Fethiye, **Green Valley** is one of the sought-after Nature Park and Campground spots. Green Valley is located in the village of YanÄ±klar, just off the main road between Fethiye and Dalaman Airport. You can easily get directions from the map, but it's worth considering that there is no phone signal in this area. After a short drive on a village road and a winding path, you will find Green Valley. Situated in the middle of a canyon with cold river waters, waterfalls, and giant trees, Green Valley is one of the coolest locations in summer. It's also worth mentioning that it's a perfect place for families to have breakfast and picnic due to its natural beauty. We believe it's the best place to cool off after enjoying the sea and sunburned skin.
