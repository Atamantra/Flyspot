## Kumburnu
We must say that the 'Kumburnu' point of Ölüdeniz's long and magnificent beach is the analytical location that gives it the name Ölüdeniz. This part of the beach, where the waves do not hit and are shallow along the coast, is the most preferred place for families with children. Whether you rent a sunbed, use the restaurants and cafes, or reserve your own spot with picnic supplies, Kumburnu, with its large parking lot and beautiful stony footpath, will be on your right when facing the [tour boats](/oludeniztekne/).

## What to Do in Ölüdeniz
In both of these adjacent beaches belonging to the Ölüdeniz neighborhood, you can spend a perfect beach day, and you can also engage in water sports. You can also visit the Blue Cave, Cold Water, Butterfly Valley, Camel Beach, Aquarium Bay, and Gemiler Island with day trips exploring the [6 Islands from Ölüdeniz](/oludeniztekne/). If you prefer to do hourly diving instead of daily in Fethiye, you can join a diving tour that lasts a total of 2-3 hours with boats departing from the Ölüdeniz harbor 4-5 times a day. And the main attraction here is paragliding. With our special vehicles or by cable car according to your preference, you can experience a 20-30 minute flight after ascending to the 1965-meter height of Babadağ, offering one of the most beautiful activities in this geography. After your flight, you land safely in one of the designated landing zones on Ölüdeniz Beach and gain a lifetime experience in about 1.5-2 hours. After landing, you can obtain your videos, photos, and 360 views even without a pilot.
