## Hisarönü
Hisarönü is also known as the "Little English Village" by the locals of Fethiye. Here, there is a seasonal city life within the nature of Fethiye. Many cuisines from various countries such as China, India, England, America, and Turkey are represented, with numerous bars and nightclubs offering their services. While strolling through the streets, you'll often encounter loud music and people dancing in Hisarönü, along with many shops. Tattoo shops, hairdressers, and beauty centers are also popular choices among tourists. The supermarkets and amusement parks located in the center guide us between the hotels and the market. We believe that no one should visit Fethiye without stopping by Hisarönü.
