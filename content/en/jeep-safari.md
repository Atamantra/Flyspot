### Fethiye Jeep Safari
Our daily Jeep Safari tour starts early in the morning and ends in the evening. Lunch will be included in our tour and will be served in **Yakapark.** Our vehicles departing from Fethiye will begin a colorful adventure with a water fight between vehicles. 

You can buy water guns for a small fee, and if you wish, you can take a towel and spare clothes with you in order to be less worn out in the war.

Our journey will continue with our driver guiding us towards the [**Ancient City of Tlos.**](/posts/tlos-antik-kenti/) After Tlos, you will visit **Alexander's Cave**, take a breather with the unique beauty of Yakapark, have lunch and get back on the road. In our next stop, Saklıkent, you will take a canyon trip with its crystal clear water, one of the main natural wonders, and if you wish, you will enjoy the river with adrenaline with **Ringo rafting.** After the Saklıkent tour, the mud bath will feel like therapy for both your skin and your soul, and after you are satisfied with the mud, you can take a shower and set out on your way back with your sweet tiredness.

 The activity will include your transfer, insurance, lunch and guide. Your photos taken during the tour will be shown to you after the activity, you can purchase them if you wish.
