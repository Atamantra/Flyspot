    - question: When Should I Do A Reservation For Paragliding
      answer: All up to you. You can fly almost throughout a year. However, we recommend you booking at least 7 days before the day you wish to fly. If there’s less than 7 days remaining before your desired date, you can just call us. Of course, you can book a few months before your desired date with our assurance of a fixed price.
    - question: What Happens If The Parachute Fails To Open When Taking Off?
      answer: Such situations never happen! Parachutes are already opened on the ground and we do not start our flight with jumping off. A parachute rises up overtop after we take a few steps, and finally our flight starts after another few steps. In fact, your flight already starts while steps are taken. Your flight is never something like jumping off a cliff.
