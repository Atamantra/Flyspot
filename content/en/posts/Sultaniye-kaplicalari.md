## Sultaniye Thermal Springs

Located 4 kilometers from Dalyan village, you can visit Sultaniye Thermal Springs all year round. It ranks as Turkey's second highest (98.3 Ci) radioactive thermal spring after the one in Indonesia. Situated at the foot of the Ã–lemez Mountains, Sultaniye Thermal Springs also serves as a thermal treatment center with its healing mud baths. These springs, which are beneficial for rheumatic pains, joint calcifications, and improving blood circulation, are among the places that must be visited in Dalyan. If you are coming to Fethiye by car, we recommend first relaxing in the thermal springs and then continuing to the city.
