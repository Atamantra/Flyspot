### Fight With The Mad Torrent 
##### The place where you do Fethiye rafting is the Dalaman river. After a short docs given by instructor, you feel yourself ready for the Fethiye rafting. During the joyful activity starting after the docs, you enjoy the feeling of the cold water splashed onto your face, constantly and totally controlled by the experienced instructor. The water of the Fethiye Rafting field is quite clean, and amateur rafting fans can enjoy rafting there all year around.

### Non-Participants Allowed

Some agencies may offer you visits to some museums on the course during the activity. Don’t miss this perk. To join the rafting, you need to be over 14 years old and should know how to swim. Also it’s required that you are not prone to asthma attacks or circulatory conditions. And also, most of agencies do not take people over 70. If everything is all right for you, do not miss the chance.
