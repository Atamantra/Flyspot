  description: This trip was amazing. Very friendly staff. The ride itself was super fun! We were able to do tricks which was very cool. Landing and take off were both very smooth. We paid $35usd for photos and videos from the flight and they were well worth it as the angles were great. Would highly recommend using these guys for your next flight! Thanks boys

  description: I had the best pilot you could ever wished for. Thanks Ata for one of the best experiences. I felt so safe and comfy throughout the whole journey. He even had a boom box with nice music up in the air. I had a blast and highly recommend this.
