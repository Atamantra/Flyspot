## It takes its name from the butterflies living in the valley.

Butterfly Valley, which mesmerizes us with its natural beauty, is one of the places you must see in Fethiye. Due to its untouched nature and the extreme difficulty of reaching it by land, the most suitable way to go is by [boat](/oludenizboat). Offering mesmerizing views that enchant those who see them, it is especially preferred by those who want to go camping. At the same time, it is quite ideal for day boat trips. If you do not want to join a boat tour, you need to pay a certain entrance fee to stay in Butterfly Valley.

Being under protection as a first-degree natural site, Butterfly Valley is a place you must visit and, if the weather is suitable for paragliding, your pilot can show you a spot in the air during your [paragliding](/paragliding) flight.
