## St. Nicolas Island
#### Explore Gemiler Island, home to old churches from long ago. People say it's where Saint Nicholas (Santa Clouse) was buried first. Christians hid here from the Romans and then made a town. But Arabs came later, and everyone left. Now it's empty, but you can visit and see the ancient buildings and beautiful views. Gemiler Island is waiting for you to discover its story.

## Camel Beach
#### Camel Beach has awesome sand, perfect for swimming and sunbathing. The shallow water is great for both swimmers and non-swimmers, especially kids. It's called Camel Beach because of the stones that look like camel humps.
