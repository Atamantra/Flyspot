# Calis Beach
Calis Beach is preferred more for surfing, some water sports, and entertainment rather than swimming. The sea is a bit rocky and quite open, so the area tends to have a windy climate. Calis Beach also has a promenade along the beach, where you can find live music, jewelry shops, restaurants, and cafes to spend time at. Nearby, there is also an aqua park which is quite fun. Overall, this location, where dynamic and alcoholic entertainment come together, is one of the must-see places.
