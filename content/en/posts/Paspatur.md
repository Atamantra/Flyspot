## The Story Behind Paspatur's Name

Known as the place where the heart of the city beats or where life is vibrant, Paspatur got its name from the French of the period, and the fountain in the middle is also called Paspatur. The bazaar built around it includes local tourist shops, herbalists, as well as accommodation, bars, and historical details close to the harbor, making it a worthwhile bazaar to visit. It is one of the first places tourists inquire about addresses in Fethiye and is among the first places they learn about. With beautiful boutique venues offering delicious meals and snacks, Paspatur is a location that can cater to all ages and preferences.
