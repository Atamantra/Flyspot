## One of the Most Important Cities of the Ancient Lycian Civilization

This settlement, built on the ruins of Karmylassos, is now known as **Kayaköy**. Located approximately 8-10 km away from the center of Fethiye, Kayaköy is an old city consisting of stone houses. Formerly known as Lebessos, Kayaköy offers a unique opportunity for those who want to get to know the rich history of Fethiye more closely. It has a wonderful walking path where you can see the remnants of the ancient settlement at every step you take. Besides being a historical site, it is also visited by both local and foreign tourists due to its unforgettable views.

Being within walking distance to Ölüdeniz, albeit long, makes it a popular choice for accommodation especially in the summer months. You can also take a leisurely horse ride tour, which we're sure you will enjoy immensely. At the starting point of the horse ride, there is a rustic restaurant and charming pergolas where you can buy souvenirs. If you're going for a horse ride, it might be a nice gesture to bring a snack like apples or carrots for the horse and feed it, which can be a pleasant way to establish a connection. We recommend giving Kayaköy, which is a magnificent visit point to revive history with your own eyes, a chance, and while you're there, don't forget to pick some fresh thyme.
