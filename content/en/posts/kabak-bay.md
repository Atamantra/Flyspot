## Kabak Bay
Kabak Bay, with its pristine sea and unforgettable landscapes, mesmerizes those who see it and is one of the most beloved places in the summer months. You can reach this secluded paradise both by road and by sea. If you prefer to go by sea, renting a [speedboat](/oludenizboat) would be the most suitable choice. Located within the boundaries of Faralya Village in Fethiye, this bay has a captivating beauty. If you wish to stay in Kabak Bay, you can choose bungalows or guesthouses, or for a more adventurous stay, you can camp. Especially during the night, we highly recommend not to miss the unique view offered by the thousands of stars surrounding the sky. If your path leads you to this bay, we suggest visiting Aladere Waterfall (Kabak Waterfall). If you can't find the beginning of the road to the waterfall on your way to the beach, you can ask anyone around. Along the road to the waterfall, you'll find blue-white-red markings left with paint, guiding you throughout the way. At the beginning, a sign will assist you in choosing between a shorter but riskier path and a longer and safer one. The shorter one takes about half an hour, while the longer one takes about an hour. Along the waterfall trail, you'll encounter plane trees and carob trees. It's advisable to bring water and snacks with you for this walk, where you'll be surrounded by unique nature. Kabak Bay, where you can see every shade of green and blue, despite having rough seas, stands out as a unique place with its cleanliness.
