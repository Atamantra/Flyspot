#### Within the tour program, your first stop will be the Rock Tombs, which have survived from the Lycian civilization to the present day. These magnificent rock tombs, carved with astonishing delicacy into cliffs rising at an angle of 80 degrees, are considered a testament to the wealth and power of the ancient city of Kaunos.

#### Following the visit to the rock tombs, you'll continue your journey through the reed beds of the Lagoon. Guests have the opportunity to taste the flavors of Blue Crabs and don't forget to have your cameras ready to capture the moments of seeing Caretta Caretta sea turtles.
#### Upon arrival at Ä°ztuzu Beach, guests will have two hours to enjoy swimming. It's time to meet with the crystal-clear sea, fine sands, and warm Aegean sun.

#### After the two-hour swimming break, our boat will depart for our restaurant to introduce you to the flavors of the southern Aegean cuisine. We'll take you to our restaurant through the richness of natural life among the reeds, where you can see birds, Caretta Caretta turtles, and fish. Our waiters will serve an Ã  la carte plate adorned with Aegean flavors such as shakshuka, potato salad, tzatziki, spaghetti, rice, and seasonal salad, along with your choice of chicken or fish.

#### It's time to relax your mind, which was amazed by the splendor of the rock tombs, your body tired from swimming at Ä°ztuzu, and your skin warmed by the sun, with a Mud Bath. The Natural Mud Bath and thermal hot water, which were a favorite spot for many international celebrities in the 1990s like Dustin Hoffman and Sting, will make you feel good. Don't forget to take photos.

#### After the mud bath, we head to KÃ¶yceÄŸiz Lake to take a swim. Swimming in the fresh and cool waters of KÃ¶yceÄŸiz Lake is a real chance to refresh for our bodies warmed by the Aegean sun. Then, guests who wish can visit the ancient city of Kaunos, while those who say "I've had enough" will conclude the tour. Guests who do not participate in the tour of the Kaunos Ancient City can make up for this the next day free of charge.
