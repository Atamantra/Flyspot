## Alexander's Cave
Known as the **Isli Cave of Alexander** in ancient times, the name "Iskender" is the Turkish adaptation of Alexander. This cave, located approximately 40km from Fethiye, shares the same road with the ancient city of Tlos. With its narrow entrance and widening inside, adorned with stalactites and stalagmites, this cave embraces you with the feeling of being in a different world. You can also visit this cave as part of local activity tours such as Jeep Safari, along with other locations.

You can visit this area with our Jeep Safari Activity.
